							<h4>Measuring the Return on Infrastructural Investment in Student Learning </h4>
						</header>
						<div class="inner">
							<h3>Purpose</h3>
							<p>Active learning has been a rising educational trend, as student-centered teaching have gained ground in higher education since the 1970s and 1980s. Early iterations of this approach include Paulo Friere's (1970) liberatory pedagogy and Kenneth Bruffee's (1993) collaborative learning, which emphasize students' (co)creation of knowledge in the classroom as opposed to passive consumption of information delivered by faculty members, reflecting pedagogical philosophies that extend back to the early 20th century in the work of constructivists John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, active learning began to attract increasing attention in STEM fields in response to demands from industry to produce more STEM graduates by--among other things--improving recruitment and retention in STEM undergraduate programs. Funded by large grants from the NSF and other agencies, STEM faculty began large controlled experiments testing the impact of specific active learning methods like demonstration predictions, think-pair-share, minute papers, strip sequences, student-generated test questions, et cetera in entry-level courses in disciplines like physics, biology, and math, which flip the classroom by replacing traditional lectures with student activities which test and apply students' growing understanding of course content. Researchers demonstrated that active learning methods improved students' engagement (Hake, 1998), self-concept/persistence (Colbeck, Cabrera, & Terenzini, 2001), and learning (Freeman et al, 2014). These findings have been particularly pronounced for underrepresented groups, showing that active learning can close the persistent performance gaps experienced by gender minorities (Phuong & Nguyen, 2019) and racial minorities (Haak et al, 2011; Snyder et al, 2016; Ballen et al, 2017) in STEM.

							Classroom infrastructure remains an understudied variable in the active learning equation. As Brooks (2011) demonstrates, the results of active learning pedagogies vary depending on classroom type: in classrooms designed for lecturing, which separate students from one another and anchor them in place while focusing all attention on the instructor, students learn less from active methods because of the logistical hurdles created by the classroom's design. In recognition of this, throughout the 2010s colleges and universities have begun building active learning classrooms to encourage instructors to adopt active learning methods. In some cases (Ingram et al, 2012; Violette et al, 2012) instructors receive training and develop curricula designed for active learning classrooms. In other cases, however--as at Santa Clara--faculty find themselves assigned to teach in active learning classrooms without notice or training, although in an educational climate where students, faculty, and administrators are increasingly invested (to varying degrees) in the forms and outcomes of active learning. As active learning methods and classrooms become more "mainstream" in university education, will we see similar impacts as the initial experiments in active learning produced?

							This study used automated aerial photography to document the instructional formats used in 74 courses taught in humanities, social sciences, engineering, and business disciplines in 12 active learning and 2 traditional (control) classrooms. We used the machine learning tools available in Matlab to analyze the photos to identify instances of lecture format, large group discussion, small group discussion, approximating different active learning formats. The next stage of the project will cross-reference these breakdowns of the kinds of pedagogical techniques used and their proportions, and correlate them to student learning outcomes (measured by grades), broken down by student demographic factors.

							<h3>Technical Documentation</h3>
							<p>Classroom Configuration Identifier (CCID) is an application built in Matlab which uses AlexNet in order to classify ../images of Santa Clara University's classroom configurations into the following four categories with 97% accuracy:  1. Forward-Facing Lectures 2. Circular or 'U' Shaped Lectures and/or whole class discussions 3. Smaller Group discussions and 4. Empty classrooms. </p>
							<p> CCID is a critical component of a larger tool under construction for the ongoing study which seeks to understand the effects of classroom configuration on student learning outcomes. </p>
							<p> Specifically, CCID generates classification data of a classroom's configurations over the course of a school term which is then coupled with anonymized student data in order to determine the correlations between classroom layout and student academic performance. </p>
							<p> Ultimately, this study will be able to supply educators with the information needed to setup more effective learning environments for their students. </p>
