## Overview of TailorEd
Our study used automated aerial photography to document the instructional formats used in 74 courses taught in humanities, social sciences, engineering, and business disciplines in 12 active learning and 2 traditional (control) classrooms. We used the machine learning tools available in Matlab to analyze the photos to identify instances of lecture format, large group discussion, small group discussion, approximating different active learning formats. The next stage of the project will cross-reference these breakdowns of the kinds of pedagogical techniques used and their proportions, and correlate them to student learning outcomes (measured by grades), broken down by student demographic factors.
