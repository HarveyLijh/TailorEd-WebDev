                        Our study used automated aerial photography to document the instructional
						 formats used in 74 courses taught in humanities, social sciences, engineering,
						  and business disciplines in 12 active learning and 2 traditional (control) classrooms.
						   We used the machine learning tools available in Matlab to analyze the photos to identify
						    instances of lecture format, large group discussion, small group discussion, approximating
							 different active learning formats. The next stage of the project will cross-reference these
							  breakdowns of the kinds of pedagogical techniques used and their proportions, and correlate
							   them to student learning outcomes (measured by grades), broken down by student demographic
							    factors.

Faculty and students teaching/taking classes included receive an email notifying them of inclusion of their class in the study, which directs them to this webpage, that provides information about the study, explains where to direct questions, and informs about how to opt out of the study. There are also signs posted in all study classrooms notifying faculty and students that the classroom is part of the TailorEd Study.

We will start with the motivation behind this project and explain how we have gathered our data, guide the attendees through a human qualitative data coding practice via a hands on exercise, introduce our Classroom Configuration Identifier (CCID) image classifier neural network via a live demo, share our preliminary results and explain our data modeling procedure, demo our resulting web tool for educators, and end by delineating the project’s future steps.

                                as sample photos illustrate, people who know the individuals depicted may be able to recognize them. To mitigate this, individuals included in classroom photographs will never be identified in any part of this study, limiting the risk of identifiability more broadly. The photos also depict a "public" event (class meetings), and therefore do not contain sensitive or compromising information.

This ensures that we don't send emails to students who are no longer enrolled in study classes and that we don't miss any enrolled students who add the class late.
