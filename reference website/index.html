                        Our study used automated aerial photography to document the instructional
						 formats used in 74 courses taught in humanities, social sciences, engineering,
						  and business disciplines in 12 active learning and 2 traditional (control) classrooms.
						   We used the machine learning tools available in Matlab to analyze the photos to identify
						    instances of lecture format, large group discussion, small group discussion, approximating
							 different active learning formats. The next stage of the project will cross-reference these
							  breakdowns of the kinds of pedagogical techniques used and their proportions, and correlate
							   them to student learning outcomes (measured by grades), broken down by student demographic
							    factors.

                                        classroom design (for example, mobile vs. stationary desks),

                                    <li>
                                        teaching formats (lecture, discussion, small group work, use of classroom technology, etc), and

                                        student performance (measured by grades), and student characteristics (race, gender, major, etc).

                                Its goal is to test the claims made in learning space design researchers that active learning formats (such as discussion and small group work) improve learning, especially for students marginalized in educational settings due to their gender, race, and other identity characteristics. 
Faculty and students teaching/taking classes included receive an email notifying them of inclusion of their class in the study, which directs them to this webpage, that provides information about the study, explains where to direct questions, and informs about how to opt out of the study. There are also signs posted in all study classrooms notifying faculty and students that the classroom is part of the TailorEd Study.

                                as sample photos illustrate, people who know the individuals depicted may be able to recognize them. To mitigate this, individuals included in classroom photographs will never be identified in any part of this study, limiting the risk of identifiability more broadly. The photos also depict a "public" event (class meetings), and therefore do not contain sensitive or compromising information.
